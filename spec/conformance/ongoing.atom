<h2 id='p-3'>1.9</h2>
<p>Check out Tor Norbye’s write-up on 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/ruby_screenshot_of_the_week24">using
NetBeans to migrate to 1.8</a>.</p>
<p>Sam Ruby reported at length on
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/12/31/Porting-REXML-to-Ruby-1-9">Porting REXML to Ruby 1.9</a>
and, get this, check

happened</a> to his patch.

stopped</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Rubinius</h2>
<p>First of all,
<a href="http://blog.fallingsnow.net/">it runs IRB</a>; I remember the JRuby
guys having surprising difficulty there; thus this has to be a real milestone.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> is Rubinius World
Headquarters, and they just
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/2008/1/11/engine-yard-benchmark-capital">took
a butt-load of money</a> from Benchmark Capital.
Frankly, I’m dubious about the value of most Venture Capital investments in
the modern Web economy; but if it keeps Rubinius moving along it’s A Good
Thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Rails</h2>
<p>Shortly after I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/03/Prediction-Rails">predicted good times
for Rails</a>, there was the infamous
<a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">Zed rant</a>
which is worth reading, not for the morsels of truth possibly burrowed in the
billows of bile, but for the flame itself, which is monumental in its scope
and ambition.  Sample: “Jesus fucking christ on a goddamned pike you absolute
mother fucking donkey dick sucking morons get a fucking grip!”
The production is so obviously staged that it’s hard to get mad at its
infantile drama-queen rhetoric; but I’ll make an exception for Zed’s dissing
the people coming over to Rails from PHP; it’s a <em>good</em> thing if people
who haven’t spent years on the theory can still build decent Web sites.</p>
<p>For the kinder, gentler, Zed, read Joe Gregorio’s
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/282/Tim-Bray-on-Ruby-on-Rails">Tim Bray on
Ruby on Rails</a>, which sees Rails as being in decline (but read Joe’s
commenters too).
I find that really hard to believe, since more or less everything Web-related
is growing, it’s the relative speeds that matter; but the January
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">Tiobe Index</a> is interesting.
Python, you know, not much hype but lots of real work getting done.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Frameworks</h2>
<p>You know, it’s not all Rails any more.  Camping, Merb, and hey, here’s the
pretty nice looking
<a href="http://ramaze.net/">Ramaze</a> which thoughtfully includes a list of
<a href="http://ramaze.net/#other-frameworks">other Ruby Web frameworks</a>.
I call that damn sporting.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Performance Picture</h2>
<p>Check out the second graphic in Dion Hinchcliffe’s
<a href="http://hinchcliffe.org/archive/2008/01/10/16613.aspx">Creating Open
Web APIs: Exploring REST and WOA in Rails 2.0</a>.  Dion deploys a few too
many words and pictures for my taste, but the graphic entitled “21st Century
Web Development” is thought-provoking.</p>

<p>There’s a boring press release; and interesting write-ups from

Reinacker</a> and
<a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3461">Brent Simmons</a>.
(Oh, and why is it we need press releases any more?)
This is interesting on a bunch of grounds.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why a Newsreading Client?</h2>
<p>There are those, hardwired to Google Reader or some such, who genuinely
don’t understand why someone would use client software at all.  Google Reader
is just fine, but I still haven’t seen anything that gets me the news anywhere
near as fast or as flexibly as NetNewsWire.  Well, and it makes offline catch-up
very easy, but mostly it’s just about the speed.  If you’ve got a job where
you need to soak up a big news-flow without wasting much time, and you’re on a
Mac, you really ought to give NNW a try.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Business Model</h2>
<p>Why would you give away popular 
software?
Quoting Greg Reinacker: “What we’re working to do is to saturate the market
with our clients.”  Which makes excellent sense; because they’re really in the
server/service business.</p>
<p>Plus, they think they can do something interesting with attention data.
Not the first time I’ve heard that, and it’s sure plausible, although I’m not
sure anyone’s actually making much hay with it just yet.</p>
<p>But hey, thanks guys.</p>

<p>I just made my annual donation to
<a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a>.  If you want to deal with
MS Office and OpenOffice.org and ODF documents on the Mac and you don’t want
to buy any overpriced opaque binaries, it’s your best bet.  The
new news
is that that the latest NeoOffice (2.2.2) startup is irritatingly slow on my
2GHz MacBook.  Which, you see, is <em>good</em> news, because previous
combinations of older NeoOffices and older Macs started up painfully,
agonizingly, slow.  For those of us who live on the Web, at this point in
history it’s hard to feel much love for office-doc processing software; but of
its kind, Neo is really not bad.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's a major struggle going on between “RIAs” (Rich Internet
Applications) and AJAX, which tries to do everything in the browser using just
what the browser ships with. RIA frameworks are AIR (“Flash, the Next
Generation”), Silverlight (“Microsoft wants in”) and JavaFX (“Isn't
open-source better?”) I'm not brave enough to predict who wins, but I do
predict that 2008 will be a crucial year; either RIAs enter the mainstream, or
they start to smell like a red herring left in the sun.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-2'>Suspicion</h2>
<p>Ever since we’ve had the Web, we’ve had those who say it’s Not Good Enough.
I’ve long been among the RIA skeptics, for a couple of reasons.  First, let me
quote myself, from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/19/Continuations-and-GUIs">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This notion, that the Web GUI is insufficiently interactive and
we need something richer, is widely held among developers and almost never
among actual users of computers, and it’s entirely wrong. I can remember when
people were forced to use compiled Windows and X11 applications, and most of
them were extremely bad because it’s really hard to design a good interactive
UI; when the Web came along, more or less everyone abandoned those UIs in
favor of the Web, almost instantly and with shrieks of glee. Yes, Web UIs are
drastically constrained, offer a paucity of controls, and enforce a brutally
linear control flow; and these are good things. I remember, in the early days,
people saying “Once you know how to use one Windows app, you know how to use
them all”. Ha ha ha. But you know what? Once you know how to use a browser,
you are well on the way to being able to use most Web apps. The best AJAX apps
are still very Web-like (as in, the Back button always works); but they’re
faster and more responsive and nicer to look at. The worst AJAX apps are like
bad Nineties VB.</p></blockquote>
<p>I stand by my point: the people who want to add UI “richness” to the Web
are always developers, never users.  Doesn’t mean they’re wrong; after all,
the users weren’t clamoring for the Web before it arrived, either.</p>
<p>My other problem is that while I like my Internet applications to be rich,
I have this old-fashioned notion that “richness” is mostly about 
compelling words and pictures and sounds and especially, most especially,
interaction with living people.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>On The Other Hand</h2>
<p>I use Rich Internet Applications all the time.  Mail. iTunes.  In fact all
rich applications have become Internet applications: I can publish 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments with a keystroke in Emacs, and create
a Web slide-show from Lightroom.</p>
<p>But that’s not what they mean when they say RIAs; they mean “Whatever lies
in the direction that Flash is pointing.”  Which puzzles me, because near as I
can tell, Flash is most useful for watching movies portably (a la YouTube) and
cool casual games like
<a href="http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/n.html">N</a> and
<a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/Game.asp">Desktop Tower
Defense</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>But I Could Be Wrong</h2>
<p>I’ve always seen it as a big problem that at the end of the day, Flash is
proprietary.  So is Silverlight (although it’s <em>damn</em> interesting that
it runs on OS X).  JavaFX tries to remove that problem.  Maybe if we unleash
the creativity of all the people who just don’t want to be
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace">sharecroppers</a> on someone else’s
plantation, we’ll see some RIAs that are actually interesting to business.</p>
<p>But don’t kid yourself that it’ll be easy.  The browser already offers what
most people (who aren’t software developers) consider an excellent user
experience, and AJAX, done well, makes it even better.</p>

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/01/Predictions">described here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>There will be massive, newsworthy, churn in the
social-networking space, as Facebook creaks under the strain of its own size
and growth, and nimbler competitors find chinks in its armor.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-1'>Told Ya So</h2>
<p>This one came true within a week of me making it:
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/04/erased/">Scoble got erased</a>.
Yes, there are multiple sides to that issue.  But it’s a hot issue
nonetheless; since Facebook and its competitors are trying to become the
experience of the Internet for a huge number of people, minor disturbances in
that weather system quickly become major issues.</p>
<p>Let me crank that prediction up a bit: The Scoble imbroglio will be just
one of many Social Networking Scare stories this year.</p>
<p>Hold on a second... there’ve been two already since that one blew up.
From Toronto, 
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/01/04/rengel-facebook.html?ref=rss">serious
legal-disclosure issues</a> and from Fortinet,
<a href="http://www.fortiguardcenter.com/advisory/FGA-2007-16.html">insecure

them. Some of them might already have come true.</p>

<p>This is the fourth of five predictions for 2008, expanded from the short

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/01/Predictions">described here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>PHP will remain popular but its growth will slow, as people get
nervous about its maintainability and security stories.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ambivalent, that’s me; I totally have a love/hate relationship with PHP.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>Yes, ...</h2>
<p>It’s enabled
huge numbers of people to create decent Web sites without having to learn too
much or try too hard; a very good thing.  Also, it runs pretty fast.  Plus,
it’s been used to build some of the most instructive and useful apps out
there, like MediaWiki and WordPress.</p>
<p>So I totally think PHP has earned its huge community and thriving ecosystem
fair and square; good on it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>... and No</h2>
<p>On the other hand, speaking as an actual computer programmer, I really
dislike PHP.
I find it ugly and un-modular and there’s something about it that encourages
people to write horrible code.  We’re talking serious maintainability pain.</p>
<p>Also, I observe a certain amount of tension involving the
community and Zend.  
Symptoms may be observed, among other places, at
<a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/">hardened-php.net</a>.
I was going to drop in a wry comment about the
elusiveness of “The PHP Group” who own all the copyrights and so on, and just
now failed to find a pointer to the
page which lists them (I know it exists, I’ve seen it), so I guess that’s
self-referentially wry enough. 
And you have to raise your eyebrows over the course of the transition from
PHP4 to PHP5.</p>
<p>Finally, some recent hands-on experience: a big project I’m peripherally
involved with needed to include an outward-facing Wiki, and I suggested that
MediaWiki was damn good stuff.  They put in quite a bit of work and failed to
get MW to integrate with the rest of the system.  Yes, it’s a good wiki, but it
shouldn’t have been that hard to make it play nice with others, and I got the
impression that the PHP-ness of it was a big part of the problem.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>I Could Be Wrong</h2>
<p>At the 2006 Zend conference, Andi or Zeev (I forget which) took a question
about Rails and said “Ruby is appropriate for computer-science-loving people
who have a puristic attitude.”  Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Under My Sun Hat</h2>
<p>I think we need to do a much better job of
supporting PHP natively in Solaris and NetBeans and so on up and down the
stack.  But at the same time, I can’t honestly encourage people to use it for
building anything new.</p>
<p>And I think I’m far from alone in that impression.</p>

The ecosystem gets more interesting all the time.

<p>This is the third of five predictions for 2008, expanded from the short
form generated on short notice as 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/01/Predictions">described here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rails will continue to grow at a dizzying speed, and Ruby will
in consequence inevitably become one of the top two or three strategic choices
for software developers. But at the same time, other frameworks and tool-sets
are learning its lessons, so Rails will get some serious
competition.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-2'>I Hear a Very Gentle Sound</h2>
<p>I don’t know anyone who’s actually doing methodologically respectable
head-counts of Web developers, so any opinion from anyone is based on anecdotal
evidence at best.  But these days, based on <em>my</em> anecdotal evidence,
everything I see and smell, the white-hot
pace of Rails adoption isn’t slowing down at all.</p>
<p>Rails drags Ruby along behind it, and good programmers who are exposed to
Ruby tend to become addicted pretty quickly.</p>
<p><i>[Hoisted from Comments]</i> Joe Gregorio
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/282/Tim-Bray-on-Ruby-on-Rails">argues</a>
that Rails peaked in mid-2006 and is now declining.  But read his comments,
too.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Who’s Watching</h2>
<p>There is one group of technologists who are now 100% familiar with Rails.
I’m speaking of the developers of competitive Web frameworks, many of whom
felt somewhat smacked upside the head by Rails’ sudden noisy chomp into their
market share.</p>
<p>By and large, they’re not stupid.  They may not have been as quick to
notice the things that DHH and the other Railsists noticed, but they’ve
noticed them now, and more or less every other piece of the Web ecosystem has
something “Rails-like” in hot development or in production.  Some of the names
to watch are
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (based on Python), 
<a href="http://liftweb.net/">lift</a> (based on Scala), and
<a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a> (based on Groovy).
But I predict fearlessly that there will be a Real Important Web-framework
grabbing mindshare a year from now that’s learned Rails’ lessons but ain’t one
of those.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>I Could Be Wrong</h2>
<p>Maybe the population of developers will wake up, shake their heads, and say
“Nah, going back to PHP, it’s faster” or “Actually, now I see that Java EE’s
XML configuration files are da bomb”.</p>
<p>But I don’t think so.</p>

<p>This is the second of five predictions for 2008, expanded from the short
form generated on short notice as 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/01/Predictions">described here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>The strain due to the fact that most business desktops are
locked into the Microsoft platform, at a time when both the Apple and
GNU/Linux alternatives are qualitatively safer, better, and cheaper to
operate, will start to become impossible to ignore.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-2'>Experience</h2>
<p>Around our house, we have screens connected to Windows XP, OS X, and Ubuntu
GNU/Linux.
Ubuntu and OS X are easier to install, less trouble to maintain, and more
pleasant to use.  If we were tracking the time we spend maintaining these
things, I’m willing to bet that Windows takes more care &amp; feeding than the
other two put together.  Down the road we’ll have Windows only for games, I
think.</p>
<p>We also provide tech support for our mothers, a local Pilates studio, and
various random friends, local and remote.  Wherever we can, we’re steering them
to OS X just because they’ll experience less pain and be more productive.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Pain</h2>
<p>These days, when you live mostly on OS X &amp; Ubuntu, XP is just
incredibly irritating.  There’s always something pestering you to update it:
Adobe, Java, Norton, whatever.  Plus random other whining from the bottom right
corner of the screen, about unused icons and firewall security and so on.</p>
<p>As for my family &amp; friends who aren’t pros, and who haven’t been under
the tutelage of one either, their Windows boxes are mostly smoking, diseased,
quivering heaps of goo.  Who’s got the time to deal with that shit?</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Why I Might Be Wrong</h2>
<p>I haven’t spent any time with Vista.  Possibly, after a couple of releases,
it’ll make Windows competitive again.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>From the Business Point of View</h2>
<p>I talk to the individuals and small businesses who are still running Windows,
and I compare them to those who’ve escaped, and it’s just not close.  Recently
I was helping Mairin get her system set up—a Mac mini, which BTW is a fabulous
computer for a small business—and was showing her how to do
something and she said “But that’s so easy?  Why?” and I said “Well, that’s
how things work on this system” and she said “Well, why are people still using
Windows then?”</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Future</h2>
<p>Microsoft’s continuing extraction of monopoly rents is dependent, near as I
can tell, on just two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>MS Office staying good enough that people don’t
mind paying the fearful Windows tax that goes with it.  Except for, Office
runs better on OS X than on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The Exchange/Outlook lock-in.  This seems the big one to me.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-8'>Like I Said</h2>
<p>This problem is becoming increasingly impossible to ignore.  Especially now
that nearly everyone has someone in the family with a Mac.</p>

<p>I refer to Sam Ruby’s
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/12/31/Porting-REXML-to-Ruby-1-9">massive
patch</a> to make REXML work properly with the latest Ruby.
I’ve long disliked REXML (see
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/Why-JRuby">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/22/REXML">here</a>), but it’s here and it
works.  Only the <em>way</em> it works changed in 1.9, and there were some
horrible regressions, and it gets patched very slowly.  (I’m actually wondering
why Ruby needs to have a weird regex-based parser when Expat is plenty good
enough for Perl and Python, and in fact if you look at
<code>xmlparser.rb</code>, you can switch parsers, just as Nick Sieger has done for
JRuby with
<a href="http://caldersphere.rubyforge.org/jrexml/">JREXML</a>.
But I digress.) 
In the short term, we need to see if the REXML maintainers are responsive
to Sam’s patch.</p>

<p>Was listening to an argument and someone said “Gimme a break. Even the Pope
has to put his pants on one leg at a time!”  And I thought that was incredibly
lame.  To start with, the Pope wears a dress, everyone knows that.  And this
afternoon, I was changing my 18-month-old, and once the underneath
layers had been put back together, held her pants up to her
feet.  She considered them, then coolly thrust both legs through at once, her
tiny bare pink toes emerging without a hitch.  And who cares what
the Pope can’t do, anyhow?</p>

<p>I contributed to the

<a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2007/12/version_identifiers_reconsider.html">Noah
Mendelson suggests</a>, its advice that data formats version themselves is,
well, wrong.  I spent some years of my life helping design

that decision.  Hmmm.</p>
<p>There’s this guy named Bob Aman whom I’ve only met once, but I’m a 
fan.  He’s maniacally determined that Ruby shall have the world’s best
URI-handling library, so he’s building it, and it’s called
<a href="http://addressable.rubyforge.org/">adressable</a>, which is
a good name.  I was sitting on the floor talking to the RSpec guys at the last
RubyConf and Bob plunked himself down and started wondering out loud about the
best way to manage his many thousands of test cases.  Someone who’ll write
thousands of test-cases for URI wrangling is totally OK by me.</p>

as I know, Sun didn’t even know this was happening.  Gotta like that.</p>
<p>There’s an internal Sun mailing list I’m on that’s concerned with
government technology policy, and I keep seeing stories go by about
governments liking Open Source and Open Data Formats, often confusing the two
laughably, but still, it’s a real trend.  One particularly tasty example is

<p>I have a problem: I want a new HDTV, I have very specific requirements,
and I’m not which models match, or even how best to find that out.
There’s always the LazyWeb, and it’s
showing new signs of life, in the form of Dave Sifry’s
<a href="http://www.hoosgot.com/">Hoosgot</a>.  Let’s see if it can help me
find the right TV.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The TV Problem</h2>
<p>I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/05/KrashTV">bought an HDTV setup</a> to
watch the 2004 World Series; a Hitachi plasma set with only 480 lines of
native vertical resolution.  For its original purpose, watching high-def
sports broadcasts, it works just fine.  Based on what I’ve seen on other sets,
even the latest 1080p sets, I’m not sure that the nominal-1080
coming out of the satellite receiver has much more to offer than the Hitachi
can handle; and in any case it seems like there’s
<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6449_7-6810011-1.html">not much of a
case</a> for going past 720p in my form factor (see #2 below).</p>
<p>But there are two apps for which I really want the 1080.  First, my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/08/Video">video camera shoots 1080i</a>.
Second, I want to use the TV for outboard display of my pictures.  I grew up in
a family where we took slides and sometimes set up the screen and projector
for a family
slide-show.  I liked that and want to recreate it, and the current screen does
a really bad job.
Also, it looks like 1080p is a technology plateau that should last for a while.
So here are my requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1080p.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s only one place in the house to put it, so it can’t be more than
about 41 inches wide, which means 42" in whatever 
units they use to measure TV screens.</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to be really shallow, which
means either plasma or LCD I guess.  When I go to the stores, it seems that the
LCD screens please my eye a little better, but probably either would be
OK.</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to be suitable for watching live sports via satellite (but this
seems pretty well a wash with the good modern sets).</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to appear to my Mac as a 1920x1080 display, no fuss, no muss, no
<a href="http://www.madrau.com/html/SRX/indexSRX.shtml">SwitchResX</a>.
They say DVI input
is better than VGA, but I’m not sure I can see that.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple inputs is good.  Currently we have the DVD player, the
satellite, the Wii, and the DVI wire all plugged in, and I have to unplug one
to plug in the camera, which sucks.  I may have to get some sort of video switcher/receiver.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it.  I’ve done some poking around and it’s gonna be laborious
to find a box matching all the above.  But I bet there are quite a few Mac
owners out there who could put up their hand and say “Hey Tim, my
Pioneer or Sony or Toshiba or whatever is just the ticket”.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Hoosgot</h2>
<p>Hoosgot (<a href="http://www.hoosgot.com/index.php/about/">About page</a>)
scans the Technorati flow (including blog feeds and twitters) for anyone
mentioning its name or “LazyWeb” (thus, it
<a href="http://www.hoosgot.com/index.php/2007/12/31/tv-and-the-lazyweb/">includes</a> the article you are
now reading), and aggregates
short summaries.  Obviously, credit is due to Ben Hammersley for the original
<a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/">LazyWeb</a> idea.</p>
<p>If it becomes popular at all, <em>subscribing</em> to Hoosgot will become
untenable.  I currently follow it on Twitter and even in its pre-announce
phase, it’s kinda noisy.</p>
<p>I suppose the notion is that if it gets some traction, it’ll develop good
Google-karma and someone like me, looking for a TV (or for an android assistant
or blues bassist or chlamydia cure) might turn up the answer on Hoosgot.
Anyhow, it belongs at the very least in the “worth watching” category.</p>
<p>Something else interesting; I note that that Dave used WordPress to build
the front-end for this new thing.  I wonder what other strange and wonderful
uses will emerge for well-engineered personal publishing platforms.</p>
